You're tasked with analyzing the survey results that pertain to an internal company initiative called "Project Nexus," a s
ix-week pilot program aimed at improving cross-departmental collaboration through a new digital workspace platform. 
The project involved employees from various departments including IT, HR, Marketing, and Operations, who were asked to use the
platform for daily communication, document sharing, and task management. The project's goal was to evaluate the platform's 
effectiveness in enhancing productivity, streamlining communication, and meeting project deadlines.

After the pilot concluded, participants were surveyed to assess their satisfaction with the project, the
clarity and effectiveness of communication, adherence to the proposed timeline, and their overall experience 
with the new system. You plan to use the Microsoft 365 Copilot's prebuilt Analyst agent to explore the survey 
results from Project Nexus. As with any prebuilt agent, you can enter your own custom prompts, or you can use the 
agent's starter prompts. The Analyst agent's starter prompts are designed to produce quantitative, qualitative, and 
visualization analysis, and overall project insights and recommendations.
