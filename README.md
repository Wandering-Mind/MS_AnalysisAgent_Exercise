You're tasked with analyzing the survey results that pertain to an internal company initiative called "Project Nexus," a s
ix-week pilot program aimed at improving cross-departmental collaboration through a new digital workspace platform. 
The project involved employees from various departments including IT, HR, Marketing, and Operations, who were asked to use the
platform for daily communication, document sharing, and task management. The project's goal was to evaluate the platform's 
effectiveness in enhancing productivity, streamlining communication, and meeting project deadlines.

After the pilot concluded, participants were surveyed to assess their satisfaction with the project, the
clarity and effectiveness of communication, adherence to the proposed timeline, and their overall experience 
with the new system. You plan to use the Microsoft 365 Copilot's prebuilt Analyst agent to explore the survey 
results from Project Nexus. As with any prebuilt agent, you can enter your own custom prompts, or you can use the 
agent's starter prompts. The Analyst agent's starter prompts are designed to produce quantitative, qualitative, and 
visualization analysis, and overall project insights and recommendations.


## Quantitative Analysis Prompts:
-Quantitative analysis prompts:
--Which category received the highest average rating, and which received the lowest?
--How many participants rated the project satisfaction as 4 or higher?
--What percentage of participants rated timeline adherence below 3?
--Can you identify any correlations between communication effectiveness and overall experience?

## Qualitative analysis prompts:
--Summarize the most common themes in the comments section.
--Are there any recurring concerns or suggestions mentioned in the comments?
--Identify any comments that mention issues with communication or timeline.

## Insight and recommendation prompts:
--Based on the survey data, what are the top three strengths of Project Nexus?
--What are the key areas for improvement suggested by the participants?
--Provide a summary report of the survey findings with actionable recommendations.

## Quantitative visualization prompts:
--Generate a pie chart of overall ratings distribution.
--Create a bar chart comparing the average ratings for Project Satisfaction, Communication, Effectiveness, Timeline Adherence, and Overall Experience.
--Plot a histogram of the satisfaction ratings to see the distribution of ratings.
--Generate a scatter plot to analyze the relationship between Communication Effectiveness and Overall Experience.
--Create a correlation heatmap for all numeric rating categories.
--Make a box plot for each rating category to show the range and quartiles.
--Plot a line graph showing timeline adherence ratings over participants ordered by Participant ID.
